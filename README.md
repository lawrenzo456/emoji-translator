# Emoji Translator (Starter)

## What are we building?

A tiny browser app that swaps words in a sentence with emojis. 100% vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — no backend, no frameworks.

## Plain-English goal

1. Create a small dictionary of word → emoji (e.g., "pizza" → "🍕")
2. Write a function that replaces matching words in the input sentence
3. Show the translated sentence on the page

## Constraints

- Front-end only. Vanilla **HTML/CSS/JS**. No frameworks. No backend.

## Core requirements

- A dictionary object for mappings (you choose the keys/values).
- A `translate` function that:
  - takes a sentence and the dictionary,
  - replaces exact matches,
  - returns the translated sentence.
- Minimal UI to enter text and show the result.

## Stretch ideas (optional)

- Memoize repeated translations.
- Handle plurals/punctuation (`dogs` → `🐶s`, `pizza!` → `🍕!`).
- A small UI to add/remove dictionary entries.
- Support an array of sentences and show a list of outputs.

## Getting started / How to run

- Easiest: double-click `index.html` to open in your browser
- VS Code: install **Live Server** → “Open with Live Server”

## Hints

- There’s a `/hints` folder with progressive tips. Try building for **30–45 minutes** before peeking.
- Snippets provide **skeletons** (no solutions).

## Submission (optional)

- Fork, push your work, and add a short “What I learned” section to this README.

## Work style

- Solo or pair — your call.
